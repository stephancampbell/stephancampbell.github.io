   <p>I coach high-performing, agentic people in moments of transition and challenge. We work together one on one. Everything you read here was written deliberately. </p>
   <p>One thing I’ve learned in this work is that our early life experiences have an enormous impact on our personalities and behaviors. Therefore the first thing to know about me is that I am from Silicon Valley. Technology and entrepreneurial culture was the air I breathed as a kid.</p>

<p>While many of my childhood peers went into technology-adjacent industries, Big Tech was not an option for me. Like many entrepreneurs and creatives, I have an “attraction to volatility.” <a href="https://youtu.be/TeckXGffHN0?si=6xisZAMYNAw5q1qp" target="_blank">Jerry Seinfeld</a> explains this preference better than I can.</p>

<p>The problem with an attraction to volatility is simply that it means one’s life is filled with volatility. Volatility makes for a rich life—I would live no other way—but it comes with downsides. If you are reading this, you probably understand this already. That’s probably part of why you’re interested in working with me.</p>

<p>I’ve lived around the world: China, Argentina, and currently Mexico City. I speak Mandarin and Spanish. I like the feeling of being an outsider (like Colin Wilson) or a bystander (like Peter Drucker). People like me often end up as professional perspective-givers.</p>

<p>Before starting my own practice I coached for several years under Dennis Procopio at Man-UP! Life Coaching. Before that I worked as a corporate recruiter for close to a decade.</p>

<p>Outside of coaching I’m a dancer (Cuban salsa), martial artist (Brazilian Jiujitsu), visual artist (cartoons and urban sketching), and writer (this).</p>
