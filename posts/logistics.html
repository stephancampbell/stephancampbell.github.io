  <h2>Logistics</h2>

  <h3>Q: How do we meet and how often?</h3>
  <p>We meet over Zoom or over the phone once per week* for 50 minutes for the duration of our working engagement.</p>
  <p>I also take one week off per month from coaching for silence and focus on projects. I may be available via email during that week depending on my plans.</p>

  <h3>Q: What if I can't make the session?</h3>
  <p>You can make it. We meet at the same time each week. No rescheduling. Emergencies are handled on a case by case basis.</p>

  <h3>Q: How do I pay you?</h3>
  <p>Payment is usually handled via Square. I also accept Bitcoin.</p>

  <h3>Q: How long are engagements?</h3>
  <p>Six or twelve months.</p>

  <h3>Q: Do you offer a free consultation?</h3>
  <p>If you write to me and you sound like a potential client, we will speak together at length before agreeing to an engagement. But no, I don’t offer a “free consultation.”</p>

  <h3>Q: Do we communicate between sessions?</h3>
  <p>Email whenever. I always love hearing from my clients. I generally get back to you within 24 hours.</p>

  <h3>Q: What is expected of me as a client?</h3>
  <p>Have a space that is quiet and private. Show up to session.</p>

  <h3>Q: Is this confidential?</h3>
  <p>Of course.</p>

  <h3>Q: Can I record sessions so that my AI tool can analyze them?</h3>
  <p>No.</p>

  <h3>Q: What timezone are you in?</h3>
  <p>I am in Mexico City. UTC/GMT -6. There is no daylight savings time here, so my least favorite weeks of the year are daylight savings time changes, when I have to redo my entire GCal.</p>
